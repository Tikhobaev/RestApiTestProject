The developed rest API provides the following endpoints:
* GET /users - get all users
* GET /user/{id} - get user by id
* DELETE /users/{id} - remove user with id
* POST /users/create - create a new user if new email not exist
* PUT /users/update - update user if id exists and new email not belong to any user
